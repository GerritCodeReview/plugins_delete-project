      "message": "Is it possible not to leak the internal details of the `rules_jvm_external` module to plugins during the Bzlmod migration?\n\nFor example, for mockito, we could simplify it to something like `//lib/mockito`. For `commons-io`, we would first need to define a library wrapper in gerrit-core, with a comment indicating that it\u0027s intended for use with core plugins.\n\nThis approach could help streamline the transition without exposing unnecessary details to the (non-core) plugin authors during the migration phase.",
