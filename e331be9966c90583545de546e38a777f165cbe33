This is the method were the repository is opened and it should also take care to close it. As it is now, the repository is still not closed when \u0027preserveGitRepository\u0027 is true.\n\nI think it would also make sense to change the signature of the deleteGitRepository(Project.NameKey, Repository) to deleteGitRepository(Project.NameKey, File) so that the Repository doesn\u0027t need to be passed in anymore.",
