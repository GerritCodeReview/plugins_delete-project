      "message": "I think it is more robust here to catch everything, not just OrmException.  Really this made me think - I should have been catching Throwable, not just Exception.  In the future, Gerrit may not even have a db.patchComments() method (same for other DB calls below).  So if we surround the call with a catch(Throwable), this will continue to \u0027work\u0027 (it might leave some data in git, which will require updates to this plugin, but at least the plugin won\u0027t crash).\n\nThis strategy might not be the best though.  I\u0027ll defer to SOP if he has any opinion.",

      "message": "I have to disagree with this one. I think in general catching exception/throwable is a bad idea.\n\nI believe in this case we should handle exceptions correctly, I am not happy with this current patch I pushed either, it is *ignoring* the exception. I just checked out how delete was wrapped in previous references and took same path.\n\nBest practice here in my opinion would be to check if we can indeed delete the mentioned data and fail or log accordingly, currently I am afraid we would leave the database in a state where we would have a hard time figuring out what exactly went wrong, if a delete operation should fail.\n\nI am also curious what SOP would suggest.",
