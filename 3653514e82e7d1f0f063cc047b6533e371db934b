      "message": "This change is not only adding an UiAction for deleting a project, but it is also adding a REST endpoint for deleting projects. Having the REST endpoint alone is already very valueable, which makes me think that it might make sense to split this change into two changes:\n\n  1. Add REST endpoint for deleting projects\n  2. Add an UiAction for deleting projects\n\nThis splitting makes especially sense since 2. depends on some other changes in Gerrit core, while 1. could be submitted immediately. At least I would expect that the REST endpoint is mentioned in the commit message and that also documentation for it is included into the plugin documentation. Also it might make sense to seperate both aspects in the implementation, e.g. the class UiDeleteAction implements the REST endpoint for deleting projects, but from the class name this was unexpected to me as the REST endpoint has nothing to do with UI.",

      "message": "Welcome in the world of UiActions ;-) It is intentionally not splittable by design: once UiActions are supported on a screen, like it is the currently the case on CS2, every UiAction for RevisionResource and CHangeResource and ChangeResource is immediately shown on the screen, given that\n\n* Description.isEnabled(rsrc)\n* Description.isVisible(rsrc)\n\nare returning true for that action.\n\nI do agree, that the new REST endpoint should be mentioned in the plugin documentation.
