      "message": "Actually, this is not client responsibility to check against protected project name. That\u0027s the server side responsibility. And in fact, server already does that check against All-Projects plugin and remove enabled: true from the JSON entity sent to the client and set the corresponding title, e.g.:\n\n  config\n  actions:\n    delete-project~delete:\n      label: \"Delete...\"\n      method: \"POST\"\n      title: \"No deletion of All-Projects project\"\n\nUX advantage is clear: Users can still see that button, and it\u0027s disabled, and the tooltip telling her why that button is disabled.\n\nI tried to do something like: [1], but enabled: false is not respected. probably I\u0027m missing something. In any event, we should check for enabled and use it for now for setting hidden attribute (that is working) and put a comment saying, find a way to disable the button, e.g.:\n\n  attached() {\n      if (this.config \u0026\u0026 this.config.actions[\u0027delete-project~delete\u0027]) {\n        if (!this.config.actions[\u0027delete-project~delete\u0027].enabled) {\n           // TODO(davido): Find a way to disable the button\n           this.hidden \u003d true;\n        }\n      } else {\n        this.hidden \u003d true;\n      }\n    },\n\nUnrelated to this change, but the check for protected project name currently doesn\u0027t respect All-Users project. I fixed it here: [2]. This change should be rebased on top of it.\n\n* [1] http://paste.openstack.org/show/728151\n* [2] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/plugins/delete-project/+/193030",
